# METHOD-0007 — Streamlined Operations and Human-Friendly Design

This document refines the RJW-IDD methodology to improve speed, reduce overhead, and enhance human accessibility without sacrificing auditability. It introduces parallel execution paths, risk-proportionate process weight, and human-centered artefact design.

## 1. Purpose

**Goal:** Make RJW-IDD faster and easier to use by eliminating unnecessary ceremony while preserving governance where it matters.

**Principles:**

- **Context-First Planning** — Read the map before you drive (`TECH-CONTEXT`)
- **Process weight proportional to risk** — Simple changes deserve simple processes
- **Parallel by default** — Sequential gates only where dependencies require
- **Progressive disclosure** — Essential information first, details on demand
- **Automation over ceremony** — Machines handle routine checks; humans handle judgment
- **Defaults optimized for common cases** — Heavy process available when needed

## 2. Parallel-First Architecture

### Current State Problem

The standard Discovery → Execution flow enforces sequential gates that can bottleneck progress even when work streams are independent.

```text
Traditional Sequential Flow:
Research ──► Curate ──► Spec ──► Gate ──► Implement ──► Test ──► Gate ──► Deploy
   ▲                                  │
   └──────── blocked until ◄──────────┘
```

### Parallel Architecture

Restructure to maximize concurrent work where dependencies allow:

```text
Parallel-First Flow:
                    ┌─► Spec: Functional ─┐
Research ──► Curate ┼─► Spec: Quality ────┼─► Sync ──► Implement ──► Verify ──► Deploy
                    ├─► Spec: Security ───┤     ▲
                    └─► Spec: Ops ────────┘     │
                                                │
                    ┌─► Test: Unit ────────┐    │
                    ├─► Test: Integration ─┼────┘
                    └─► Doc: Updates ──────┘
```

### Sync Points

Synchronization required at these checkpoints:

| Sync Point | Purpose | Participants | Duration |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Post-Research | Align on findings before spec work | Evidence Lead, Spec Architect | 30 min |
| Pre-Implementation | Confirm specs compatible; resolve conflicts | All spec authors | 1 hour |
| Pre-Deploy | Verify all streams complete and consistent | Governance Sentinel | 15 min |

### Parallel Track Rules

**Independent Tracks (may run concurrently):**

- Functional spec ↔ Quality spec ↔ Security spec ↔ Ops spec
- Unit tests ↔ Integration tests ↔ Documentation updates
- Different feature implementations (non-overlapping scope)

**Dependent Tracks (must wait):**

- Implementation → after spec sync
- Deployment → after all verification
- Scope changes → after governance review

### Time Savings Estimate

| Scenario | Sequential | Parallel | Savings |
|----------|------------|----------|---------|
| Typical feature | 10 days | 6 days | 40% |
| Minor enhancement | 3 days | 2 days | 33% |
| Major initiative | 30 days | 18 days | 40% |

## 3. Risk-Proportionate Process

### Risk Classification

Classify changes by risk to determine appropriate process weight:

| Risk Level | Characteristics | Examples |
|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Minimal** | No behavior change; typo/formatting | Doc typos, comment updates, formatting |
| **Low** | Additive only; easily reversible | New tests, new docs, config defaults |
| **Medium** | Behavior change within component | Bug fixes, refactors, internal API changes |
| **High** | Cross-component or user-visible | Feature additions, external API changes |
| **Critical** | Security, data, or availability | Auth changes, data migrations, prod config |

## 4. Human-Centered Artefact Design

### Context-First Planning

**Before any plan is made**, the "Living Tech Context" MUST be consulted. This prevents "vibe coding" where plans are made based on assumptions rather than the actual codebase state.

**The Loop:**
1. **Read `TECH-CONTEXT.md`**: Understand constraints and patterns.
2. **Make Plan**: Ensure it aligns with the context.
3. **Update `TECH-CONTEXT.md`**: If the plan changes the stack, record it immediately.

### Progressive Disclosure Structure

Restructure all methodology artefacts to front-load essential information:

```markdown
# [Document Title]

> **TL;DR:** One-sentence summary of purpose and key takeaway.

## Quick Reference
[Most frequently needed information: key dates, contacts, commands]

## Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview for scanning]

## Details
[Full content organized by topic]

## Reference
[Appendices, deep dives, historical context]
```

### Simplified Change Log Format

Replace verbose change log entries with scannable format:

**Before:**

```markdown
| change_id | date (UTC) | description | impacted_ids | operator | verification |
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| change-20240327-01 | 2024-03-27 | Anchor governance artefacts and align method doctrine (DEC-0001). Includes creation of decision logs, change logs, stage-audit logs... [200+ words] | METHOD-0001;METHOD-0002;METHOD-0003;DEC-0001 | Governance Board | validator:pending; audit:⟦audit-id:1⟧ |
```

**After:**

```markdown
| ID | Date | Risk | Summary | Links |
|----|------|------|---------|-------|
| 2024-03-27-01 | 2024-03-27 | High | Anchor governance artefacts | [DEC-0001] [audit:1] |
```

Detailed description moves to linked decision record.

### Visual Checklists

Replace text-heavy checklists with visual progress indicators:

```markdown
## Phase Status

### Discovery ████████░░ 80%

- [x] Research planned
- [x] Harvest executed
- [x] Evidence curated
- [x] Gaps documented
- [ ] Specs aligned

### Execution ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

- [ ] Implementation started
- [ ] Tests created
- [ ] Docs updated
- [ ] Integration verified
- [ ] Deployment ready
```

### Decision Record Simplification

Provide a lightweight decision template for low/medium risk changes:

```markdown
# DEC-LITE-#### — [Brief Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD | **Risk:** Low/Medium | **Owner:** [Name]

## Decision
[One paragraph: what we decided and why]

## Alternatives Considered
- Option A — rejected because [one line]
- Option B — rejected because [one line]

## Impact
- Changes: [list affected artefacts]
- Risks: [key risks and mitigations]

## Verification
- [ ] [Specific verification steps]
```

### Cognitive Load Reduction

**Before (METHOD-0002 excerpt):**

> "Run the automated harvester (`tools/rjw_idd_evidence_harvester.py`) capturing raw output. Store logs under `logs/discovery-harvest/` (or your chosen path) and validate results with `scripts/validate_evidence.py`. Promote curated entries into `research/evidence_index.json` via `scripts/promote_evidence.py`. Update requirement ledger entries with new evidence IDs and log the harvest in `docs/change-log.md`."

**After:**

> **Harvest Evidence**
>
> ```bash
> # 1. Run harvester
> python tools/rjw_idd_evidence_harvester.py
>
> # 2. Validate and promote
> python scripts/validate_evidence.py
> python scripts/promote_evidence.py
>
> # 3. Update logs
> [Auto-generated change log entry suggested]
> ```

## 5. Automation over Ceremony

### Automated Defaults

Replace manual steps with automated defaults where possible:

| Manual Step | Automated Alternative |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Create change log entry | Auto-generate from commit + template |
| Assign artefact IDs | Auto-increment from registry |
| Link cross-references | Auto-link on save |
| Check format compliance | Pre-commit hooks |
| Verify ID uniqueness | CI validation |
| Calculate audit tags | Auto-increment on audit |

### Smart Templates

Templates should pre-populate based on context:

```markdown
# DEC-0042 — [Auto-suggested: based on branch name or recent commits]

**Decision Date:** 2024-11-29 [Auto-filled]
**Participants:** [Auto-filled from CODEOWNERS or recent activity]

## Problem Statement
[Cursor starts here]

## Candidate Thoughts
1. [Template suggests common option patterns]

## Cross-Links
- [Auto-linked: recently changed specs]
- [Auto-linked: related evidence]
```

### Pre-Commit Verification

Automate verification that currently requires manual checking:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml additions
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: check-artefact-ids
        name: Verify artefact ID format and uniqueness
        entry: scripts/validate_ids.py
        language: python
        files: '\.(md|json|csv)$'

      - id: check-cross-refs
        name: Verify cross-references resolve
        entry: scripts/validate_refs.py
        language: python
        files: '\.md$'

      - id: suggest-change-log
        name: Suggest change log entry
        entry: scripts/suggest_change_log.py
        language: python
        stages: [pre-push]
```

## 6. Streamlined Checklists

### Universal Pre-Flight (All Changes)

## 8. Metrics and Feedback

### Efficiency Metrics

Track to validate streamlining effectiveness:

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Measurement |
|--------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Low-risk cycle time | 2 days | 30 min | Commit to merge |
| Medium-risk cycle time | 5 days | 2 days | Start to merge |
| Documentation overhead | 40% of effort | 15% | Time tracking |
| Process compliance | — | >95% | Audit sampling |
| Rework due to process skip | — | <5% | Incident tracking |

### Feedback Collection

After each completed work item, capture:

```markdown
## Streamlining Feedback

**Work Item:** [ID or description]
**Risk Level:** [Minimal/Low/Medium/High/Critical]
**Process Path:** [A/B/C/D]

**Worked Well:**
- [What made this efficient?]

**Friction Points:**
- [What slowed things down unnecessarily?]

**Suggestions:**
- [How could the process improve?]
```

Aggregate feedback quarterly to refine pathways.

## 9. Integration with Trust Framework

Streamlined processes interact with METHOD-0006 trust levels:

| Trust Level | Process Access |
|-------------|----------------|
| Level 0 | Pathway A only; all others require approval |
| Level 1 | Pathways A-B; C-D require human co-pilot |
| Level 2 | Pathways A-C; D requires human approval |
| Level 3 | All pathways; serves as approver for others |

Risk classification by agents verified against trust level authorization.
