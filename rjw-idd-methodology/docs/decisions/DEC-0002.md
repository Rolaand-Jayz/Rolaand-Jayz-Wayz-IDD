# DEC-0002 — Restructure Templates Directory for Methodology Alignment

**Decision Date:** 2024-03-28
**Participants:** Governance Board

## Problem Statement

The RJW-IDD methodology references multiple artefact types (REQ, SPEC, TEST, DOC, EVD, etc.) across its documentation, but the templates directory only contained a single decision template (`PROJECT-DEC-template.md`). Teams adopting the methodology had no ready-to-use templates for requirements, specifications, evidence, tests, documentation, or governance artefacts, forcing them to create their own scaffolding and risking inconsistent implementations.

## Candidate Thoughts

1. **Minimal approach** — Keep the single decision template and rely on teams to create their own templates based on the methodology documentation.
2. **Partial expansion** — Add only the most commonly referenced templates (REQ, SPEC, TEST) while leaving others to be created as needed.
3. **Comprehensive restructure** — Create a complete template directory structure organised by artefact category, with templates for all referenced artefact types and governance tools.

## Evaluation

- **Option 1:** Lowest maintenance burden but contradicts the methodology's emphasis on standardisation and traceability. Teams would duplicate effort and produce inconsistent artefacts.
- **Option 2:** Reduces the gap but leaves governance artefacts (change logs, audit logs, ledgers) undefined, which are critical to the methodology's audit trail requirements.
- **Option 3:** Requires upfront investment but provides adopters with a complete, consistent starting point that enforces the methodology's traceability and governance principles.

## Outcome

**Selected:** Option 3 — Comprehensive restructure of the templates directory to include all methodology artefact types, organised into logical subdirectories with consistent formatting and traceability sections.

**Rejection Rationale:**

- Option 1 rejected because it undermines the methodology's core principle of standardised, traceable artefacts.
- Option 2 rejected because it leaves critical governance templates undefined, weakening the audit capability that distinguishes RJW-IDD from ad-hoc approaches.

## Implementation Summary

The templates directory was restructured as follows:

```text
templates/
├── README.md                              # Template usage guide
├── decisions/DEC-template.md              # Decision records
├── requirements/REQ-template.md           # Requirements
├── specs/SPEC-template.md                 # Specifications
├── evidence/EVD-template.md               # Research evidence
├── testing/TEST-template.md               # Test cases
├── documentation/DOC-template.md          # Documentation
└── governance/
    ├── CHANGE-LOG-template.md
    ├── STAGE-AUDIT-LOG-template.md
    ├── REQ-LEDGER-template.md
    └── LIVING-DOCS-RECONCILIATION-template.md
```

Each template includes:

- Clear usage instructions and copying guidelines
- Consistent identifier patterns aligned with the methodology
- Traceability matrices linking to related artefact types
- Revision history sections for change tracking

## Cross-Links

- `METHOD-0001`
- `METHOD-0002`
- `METHOD-0003`
- `METHOD-0004`
- `DEC-0001`

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Update the main methodology README to reference the new template structure.
2. Update the `rjw-idd-methodology/README.md` to document the expanded templates.
3. Verify add-on templates remain consistent with the new base templates.
4. Schedule quarterly review to assess template usage and identify improvements.

## Status Update — 2024-03-28

Templates directory restructured with comprehensive artefact templates. Documentation updated to reference the new structure.
