# DEC-0002 — Methodology Refinements for Speed, Human-Friendliness, and Agent Trustworthiness

**Decision Date:** 2024-11-29
**Participants:** Governance Board

## Problem Statement

The RJW-IDD methodology provides a comprehensive framework for disciplined AI-assisted development, but several areas can be refined to make it:

1. **Faster** — Reduce overhead and cycle time without sacrificing auditability
2. **More streamlined** — Eliminate redundancy and simplify workflows
3. **More effective** — Improve outcome quality and predictability
4. **More human-friendly** — Lower cognitive load and improve accessibility
5. **More trustworthy for agents** — Enable greater autonomy through verifiable behavior

## Candidate Thoughts

### Thought 1: Parallel-First Architecture

**Key Idea:** Restructure Discovery and Execution to maximize parallelism where dependencies allow, reducing linear wait times.

**Analysis:**

- Current methodology enforces strict sequential gates which can bottleneck progress
- Many spec activities don't require completed research loops
- Risk: parallel work may diverge; mitigation through checkpoint synchronization
- Benefit: 30-50% cycle time reduction in typical workflows

### Thought 2: Progressive Trust Model for Agents

**Key Idea:** Introduce an explicit trust ladder where agents earn autonomy through demonstrated reliability, with clear criteria for each level.

**Analysis:**

- Current methodology treats agent oversight uniformly regardless of track record
- Trust should be earned through measurable performance metrics
- Enables humans to focus oversight on high-risk decisions
- Risk: trust miscalibration; mitigation through automated guardrails and audit trails

### Thought 3: Lightweight Defaults with Heavy-Duty Overrides

**Key Idea:** Provide simplified defaults for common cases while retaining full ceremony for complex/critical work.

**Analysis:**

- Current checklists are comprehensive but overwhelming for simple changes
- 80% of changes are low-risk; full process overhead is disproportionate
- Risk profiles should drive process weight
- Risk: under-governance of misclassified changes; mitigation through post-hoc audits

### Thought 4: Human-Centered Artifact Design

**Key Idea:** Restructure artefacts to prioritize human comprehension with progressive disclosure.

**Analysis:**

- Current documents front-load details that obscure key information
- Summary-first, detail-later pattern improves scanability
- Templates should guide, not overwhelm
- Visual aids (diagrams, checklists) reduce cognitive load

### Thought 5: Continuous Verification Architecture

**Key Idea:** Replace gate-only verification with continuous automated checks that catch issues earlier.

**Analysis:**

- Current gates batch verification, delaying feedback
- Earlier feedback reduces rework cost
- Automated verification frees humans for judgment calls
- Risk: false positives causing alert fatigue; mitigation through tuning and confidence scoring

### Thought 6: Agent Behavioral Contracts

**Key Idea:** Define explicit behavioral contracts that agents commit to, enabling verification of trustworthy behavior.

**Analysis:**

- Trust requires predictability; contracts make expectations explicit
- Contracts enable automated compliance checking
- Violations trigger graduated responses (warn → restrict → pause)
- Creates audit trail for trust decisions

## Evaluation

| Criterion | Thought 1 | Thought 2 | Thought 3 | Thought 4 | Thought 5 | Thought 6 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Speed | ★★★ | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★☆☆ | ★★☆ | ★☆☆ |
| Streamlined | ★★☆ | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★☆ |
| Effectiveness | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★☆ | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Human-friendly | ★☆☆ | ★★☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★☆ | ★★☆ |
| Agent trust | ★☆☆ | ★★★ | ★★☆ | ★☆☆ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
| Implementation complexity | High | Medium | Medium | Low | High | Medium |

## Outcome

**Selected:** All six thoughts are complementary and should be implemented as a cohesive refinement package via two new METHOD documents:

1. **METHOD-0006-agent-trust-and-autonomy.md** — Consolidates Thoughts 2, 5, and 6 into a comprehensive agent trust framework
2. **METHOD-0007-streamlined-operations.md** — Consolidates Thoughts 1, 3, and 4 into efficiency and human-friendliness improvements

**Rejection Rationale:**

- No thoughts rejected; each addresses distinct improvement dimensions
- Implementation phased to manage complexity: human-friendliness (immediate), streamlining (short-term), trust framework (medium-term)

## Cross-Links

- `METHOD-0001` — Core methodology baseline
- `METHOD-0004` — AI agent workflows (extended by METHOD-0006)
- `METHOD-0005` — Operations support (refined by METHOD-0007)

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Create METHOD-0006-agent-trust-and-autonomy.md with trust ladder, behavioral contracts, and continuous verification
2. Create METHOD-0007-streamlined-operations.md with parallel architecture, lightweight defaults, and human-centered design
3. Update METHOD-0002 checklists to reference new streamlined pathways
4. Update METHOD-0004 to integrate trust framework
5. Update change-log.md with refinement entry
6. Schedule quarterly review to assess refinement effectiveness

## Status Update — 2024-11-29

Decision approved. METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007 drafts initiated. Change log updated.
