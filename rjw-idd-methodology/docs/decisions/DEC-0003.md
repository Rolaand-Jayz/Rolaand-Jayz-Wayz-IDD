# DEC-0003 — Integrate Streamlined Operations into Core Methodology Documents

**Decision Date:** 2024-11-30
**Participants:** Governance Board

## Problem Statement

METHOD-0006 (Agent Trust and Autonomy) and METHOD-0007 (Streamlined Operations) were added to address speed, human-friendliness, and agent trustworthiness concerns (per DEC-0002). However, the core methodology documents (METHOD-0002 Phase Checklists and METHOD-0004 AI Agent Workflows) had not yet been updated to integrate these streamlined pathways. This created a gap where practitioners would need to read multiple documents to understand how to select the appropriate process weight for their changes.

## Candidate Thoughts

1. **Leave as separate documents** — Rely on practitioners to read METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007 separately and apply the guidance themselves.

2. **Full merge** — Consolidate all streamlining content directly into METHOD-0002 and METHOD-0004, deprecating METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007.

3. **Integration with cross-references** — Add quick-start sections and summaries to METHOD-0002 and METHOD-0004 that reference the detailed guidance in METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007.

## Evaluation

- **Option 1:** Lowest change effort but creates friction for practitioners who must piece together guidance from multiple documents. Contradicts the human-friendliness goals of DEC-0002.

- **Option 2:** Maximizes discoverability but would create very long documents and duplicate content that needs maintenance. Also loses the modularity that allows METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007 to evolve independently.

- **Option 3:** Balances discoverability with modularity. Quick-start sections get practitioners moving fast; detailed guidance remains in dedicated documents for those who need depth.

## Outcome

**Selected:** Option 3 — Integration with cross-references

**Changes Made:**

1. **METHOD-0002** — Added:
   - Quick Reference callout at top pointing to pathway selection
   - "Quick Start — Select Your Pathway" section with risk flowchart
   - Streamlined checklists for Minimal/Low/Medium risk paths
   - Parallel Execution guidance for High/Critical risk
   - Agent Trust Integration table
   - Related Documentation section

2. **METHOD-0004** — Added:
   - Quick Start callout at top
   - Agent Trust Levels section with autonomy mapping
   - Streamlined Workflow Selection table
   - Streamlined Pathways section with concrete steps
   - Updated Companion Assets to reference METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007

**Rejection Rationale:**

- Option 1 rejected because it creates friction and fails to deliver on DEC-0002's human-friendliness goals.
- Option 2 rejected because it sacrifices modularity and creates maintenance burden.

## Cross-Links

- `METHOD-0002` — Updated with streamlined pathways
- `METHOD-0004` — Updated with trust levels and streamlined workflows
- `METHOD-0006` — Referenced for detailed trust framework
- `METHOD-0007` — Referenced for full streamlined operations guidance
- `DEC-0002` — Parent decision establishing the streamlining direction

## Follow-Up Actions

1. Update change log with integration entry
2. Update stage audit log with reflection
3. Monitor adoption patterns to validate pathway selection guidance works in practice
4. Quarterly review to assess whether integration depth is appropriate

## Status Update — 2024-11-30

Integration complete. METHOD-0002 and METHOD-0004 now provide quick-start pathways while preserving detailed guidance in METHOD-0006 and METHOD-0007.
